# Usage
When running the application, you will first be asked to enter an amount of numbers to sort. After entering a valid number, the program will generate the specified amount of 
random numbers and put them in a queue. Then, it will print the unsorted queue. After printing the queue, it will sort the numbers and print the newly sorted queue along with
the algorithms execution time. You will then be asked if you would like to sort again. If you enter 'Y' or 'y' you will run through the same process again. If you enter 'N' or 'n',
the application will close.
